# Time Entry Components

UI components for displaying time entries in the legacy daily view. The primary weekly view now uses components in `../weekly/`.

## Components

- **TimeEntryRow.svelte** -- Single time entry row showing time range, duration, client/contract context, description, and edit/delete actions. Uses inline delete confirmation pattern. Used by the old daily view (now superseded by the weekly view).
