## Layout Model

Apple Notes-inspired three-panel layout on desktop, single-panel drill-down on mobile.

### Panels

**Panel 1 — Contracts (far left, collapsible)**
- Lists all contracts grouped by client
- "Internal" is the default/top-level contract (for non-client work)
- **"Time Entries"** option at the top, above all contracts — this is global (all clients)
- Selecting a contract populates Panel 2 with that contract's notes
- Selecting "Time Entries" populates Panel 2 with weeks
- Panel can be collapsed to give more space to Panels 2 and 3
- **Timer widget** sits at the bottom of this panel (see below)

**Panel 2 — List (middle left)**
- **In Notes mode** (contract selected):
  - Lists notes for the selected contract
  - Sorted by creation date or modification date (toggle)
  - Notes can be pinned to the top
  - Selecting a note opens it in Panel 3
- **In Time Entries mode**:
  - Lists weeks (e.g. "W06 2026 — Feb 3-9")
  - Selecting a week scrolls Panel 3 to that week
  - Acts as a navigation index into the continuous scroll

**Panel 3 — Content (right, main area)**
- **In Notes mode**:
  - TipTap editor for the selected note
  - Full markdown editing with toolbar
- **In Time Entries mode**:
  - Continuous vertical scroll of time entries
  - Lazy-loaded by week
  - Broken into sections by day headers
  - Each week has an editable status field in its header ("Unsubmitted", "Draft ready", etc.)
  - Weekly hour totals displayed

### Focus Mode / Multi-Window (Desktop)

Behaviour depends on the runtime environment:

**Desktop (Tauri):**
- Double-clicking a note in Panel 2 opens it in a **new OS-level window** via the Tauri multi-window API
- The new window shows only the note editor (no sidebars) — a dedicated writing surface
- Multiple notes can be open simultaneously in separate windows
- Right-click a note → "Open in New Window" as an alternative to double-click
- Each window is independently resizable, positionable, and closeable

**Mobile (PWA):**
- Double-tapping a note enters **focus mode**: both sidebars collapse, note fills the entire screen
- Back button or swipe-right returns to the three-panel (or drill-down) layout
- No multi-window support (browser limitation)

## Mobile Layout

Single-panel drill-down navigation with push/pop transitions.

```
Level 1: Contracts list (default view)
    │  tap contract
    ▼
Level 2: Notes list (for that contract)
    │  tap note
    ▼
Level 3: Note editor (full screen)
```

- Back arrow / swipe-right to pop back up
- Timer widget is a persistent fixed footer across all levels
- "Time Entries" follows the same drill-down: Contracts → Weeks → Week detail

## Timer Widget

Persistent widget at the bottom of the contracts panel (desktop) or as a fixed footer (mobile).

### States

**Idle:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  ▶ Start Timer              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Running:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏸ 01:23:45                 │
│  Started: [09:30] (editable)│
│  📎 New Note                │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Paused:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  ▶ 01:23:45 (paused)        │
│  Started: [09:30] (editable)│
│  📎 New Note                │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Stopped (completing entry):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  01:23:45                   │
│  Start: [09:30]  End:[10:53]│
│  Contract: [select]  ← required to save       │
│  Deliverable: [select]                         │
│  Work Type: [select]                           │
│  Description: [...]                            │
│  📎 New Note                │
│  [Save]  [Discard]          │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Behaviour

- **Start**: Creates a draft time entry in the database immediately (gets an ID). Timer begins counting.
- **Start time**: Always editable. Adjusting it recalculates elapsed time.
- **Pause**: Stops the clock. User must manually adjust start or end time to account for the gap. Resume continues the count from the adjusted state.
- **Stop**: Freezes the timer. End time becomes editable. Contract/deliverable/work type fields appear (required to save).
- **Save**: Requires contract selection at minimum. Saves the completed time entry.
- **Discard**: Deletes the draft time entry.
- **New Note**: Creates a new note linked to this time entry. Available from the "running" state onward (since the entry already exists as a draft).
- **Contract/deliverable/work type**: Can be selected at any point, but are required before saving.
